\usage{
runSimulation(
  spectra,
  f.start = NULL,
  f.end = NULL,
  nc = 1,
  res = 1,
  nmc = 10,
  df.log = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectra}{a list with the spectral objects `signal`, `noise`, and `snr`
from an investigated proxy record array, e.g. as obtained from
\code{\link{SeparateSignalFromNoise}}, for which to estimate confidence
intervals.}

\item{f.start}{lower end of the frequency range on which the power-law fit is
made on the proxy data; the default \code{NULL} uses the lowest frequency
of the proxy \code{spectra}.}

\item{f.end}{as \code{f.start} for the upper end; the default \code{NULL}
uses the uppermost frequency of the proxy \code{spectra}.}

\item{nc}{the number of proxy records (`"cores"`) in the array, which the
results in \code{spectra} are based on.}

\item{res}{the sampling (e.g., temporal) resolution of the proxy records.}

\item{nmc}{integer; the number of replications for the confidence interval
estimation.}

\item{df.log}{width of the Gaussian kernel in logarithmic frequency units to
smooth the spectral estimates of the simulated data; some smoothing is
usually necessary to avoid physically implausible negative power
occasionally occuring for some frequencies upon estimating the common
signal spectrum. It is suggested to use the same amount of smoothing as for
the actual proxy data, while setting \code{NULL} (the default) suppresses
smoothing.}
}
\value{
the output of \code{runSurrogates}: a list of length \code{nmc}
  where each list element is one signal and noise estimation realization.
}
\description{
Get the number of time steps underlying the input signal and noise spectra
and their powerlaw parameters, and call the Monte Carlo signal and noise
simulation \code{\link{runSurrogates}}.
