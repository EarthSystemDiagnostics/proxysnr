\title{proxysnr: Separate Signal and Noise in Climate Proxy Records}
\description{
A method to separate the common signal from local noise in a spatial network of climate proxy records using spectral analyses. The estimated signal and noise spectra can be corrected for the effects of proxy smoothing processes, time uncertainty, and measurement noise.
