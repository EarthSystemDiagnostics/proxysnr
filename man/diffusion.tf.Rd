The transfer functions were obtained using \code{?CalculateDiffusionTF} for
the site-specific diffusion lengths provided by
\code{?diffusion.length}. Isotope records were simulated at semiannual
resolution and the transfer functions interpolated in frequency space to
annual resolution. See also the respective package vignette:
\code{vignette(topic = "calculate-transfer-functions", package = "proxysnr")}.

\description{
A dataset containing the calculated diffusion transfer functions for the
DML1, DML2 and WAIS data sets from Münch and Laepple (2018) based on
numerical simulations. The transfer function describes the average effect
diffusion has on the mean of the spectra from \code{N} spatially distributed
oxygen isotope records.
