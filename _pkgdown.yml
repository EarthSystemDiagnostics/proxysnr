    Functions with names not adhering to the paradigm of using verb phrases, or
    not being descriptive enough, and which have been replaced by more
    appropriately named functions. However, in order to not break older code
    they will stay around for at least some time, and a call to one of these
    functions is piped to the respective new function.
